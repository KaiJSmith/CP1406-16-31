<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To promote the Barrier Reef Orchestra with a modern and well designed website that will provide ease of access to a larger audience.</p>
<p>Also to get more business, more life time memberships to continue the life of the business and to get more young people involved with music and performing.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the success of the website deployment, we will compare membership, social media (follows, likes), form completion and general attendence compare to the previous year.</p>
<p>Measure how many people attend events and the addition of more full time members being added to the page as it expands, then compaire to previous years.</p>
<p>Success could also be measured by evaluating the amount of times the B.R.O is contacted after the website is live, compared to the previous website.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> Aiming for a younger audience will create a new generation that will form the new basis of members for the future.</p>
<p>The webpage is designed to appeal to younger adults and teenagers, it will also target people who are interested in; joining the B.R.O, interested in attending concerts and anyone with a passion for music. Mainly targetting musicians, or people interested in orchestral music.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The website will contain an about section, which will contain information about the orchestra. A news section will also be included, which will contain upcoming concerts, as well as any other events that are important to the B.R.O. A contact section wil provide visitors with easy accessable information to contact the customer, and a image gallery will provide visitors with visual information about the orchestra.</p>
<p>Content that is relevant to each page and most importantly, to the BRO. Keeping the page design simple yet ellegent with minimal clicking and ease of scanning</p>
